# Frontend Architecture

This document explains the structure and technologies used in the frontend of the LeetCode Clone project. It is designed for both contributors and developers to understand the user-facing components and how they interact with the backend.

## ⚛️ Tech Stack

* **Framework**: React.js (with Vite for fast bundling)
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI + Lucide Icons
* **Routing**: React Router DOM
* **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + React Context
* **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
* **Markdown**: ReactMarkdown (for rendering editorial/descriptions)
* **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor
* **Realtime**: Socket.IO (leaderboard)

## 📁 Folder Structure (Simplified)

```bash
src/
├── assets/         # Static files (icons, images)
├── components/     # Shared reusable components
├── features/       # Redux slices (auth, problems, contests, etc.)
├── pages/          # Main routes/pages (Home, Problem, Contest, etc.)
├── routes/         # Route config for navigation
├── services/       # API calls (axios clients)
├── utils/          # Helper functions, constants
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
└── App.jsx         # Entry point
```

## 🧩 Major Components

### 1. **Problem List UI**

* Displays all problems with filters (difficulty, tags, status)
* Uses search, sorting, and pagination
* Accessible from sidebar navigation

### 2. **Code Editor**

* Monaco Editor with language support (C++, Java, JavaScript)
* Theme switching (light/dark)
* Run & Submit buttons
* Displays input/output/console
* Auto-formatting support

### 3. **Problem Details Page**

* Description shown in ReactMarkdown

### 4. **Contests Page**

* Lists upcoming & ongoing contests
* Countdown timer
* Contest Rules and Overview UI

### 5. **Leaderboard Page**

* Real-time updates via Socket.IO
* Shows user scores, time, language, and status

### 6. **Auth Pages**

* Login, Register, Forgot Password
* JWT stored in localStorage
* Protected routes using auth middleware

### 7. **Daily Challenge Page**

* Shows today’s question with indicator if solved
* Tracked in user’s history

## 📡 API Integration

* All APIs are prefixed with `/api/*`
* Uses Axios instance with JWT token in headers
* Displays loading state, error messages via Toasts

## 🌐 Theming & Responsiveness
