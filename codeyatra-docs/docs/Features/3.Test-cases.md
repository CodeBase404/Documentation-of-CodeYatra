# ✅ Test Cases

Test cases are used to validate the correctness and performance of the user's submitted code. Each problem includes a set of **visible** and **hidden** test cases to evaluate submissions fairly and efficiently.

---

## 📂 Types of Test Cases

### 👀 Visible Test Cases

- Shown on the problem page.
- Used for user testing via the “Run” button.
- Help users understand the expected input/output format.

Example:

```json
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 6
Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
```

### 🙈 Hidden Test Cases
Not shown to the user.

Used only during actual submission.

Help prevent hardcoded solutions and test edge cases.

### 🔧 Structure in Database
Each Problem document contains:
```js
testCases: {
  visible: [
    { input: "1 2", output: "3" },
    ...
  ],
  hidden: [
    { input: "10000 9999", output: "19999" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 🧪 Run vs Submit
| Action     | Test Cases Used         | Saved to DB? | Shown to User?    |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | --------------    |
| **Run**    | Visible test cases only | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes          |
| **Submit** | Hidden test cases only  | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No           |

### 💡 Why Hidden Test Cases?
Prevent users from hardcoding outputs.

Ensure solutions are efficient and general.

Catch corner cases like:

Empty arrays

Max limits (e.g., 10^5 inputs)

Duplicate values

Large strings

### ✅ Evaluation Logic
Each test case is passed to the code evaluator (e.g., Judge0 API):

```js
testCases.map(tc => ({
  input: tc.input,
  expectedOutput: tc.output
}));
```
The judge0 compares the actual output against the expected output and returns a verdict per test case.

### 🖼️ UI Display (Optional)
Each visible test case is shown in a styled box with:

✅ Pass or ❌ Fail icon

Inputs/Outputs

Execution Time

Hidden test cases verdicts are only shown post-submission.

### ✅ Summary
Test cases are a vital part of the code evaluation pipeline.

Visible: Help users debug during practice.

Hidden: Ensure fairness, efficiency, and real-world readiness.

Backend uses them dynamically based on the action (run or submit).
