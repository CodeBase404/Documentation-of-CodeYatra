# 📅 Daily Challenge

The **Daily Challenge** is a special feature that motivates users to solve one selected problem every day. It's visible on the homepage and rewards users for consistency.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 📌 One problem assigned per day
- ⏱️ Available for 24 hours (local time)
- ✅ Marked “Solved” upon successful submission
- 📊 Tracks user streaks
- 🧠 Problems span across varying difficulties and topics

---

## 🧠 How it Works

Every midnight (00:00 IST), the system:
1. Picks a problem from the pool (based on tags, difficulty, or rotation)
2. Assigns it as `todayChallenge`
3. Saves that problem for all users for that day

---

### 🔁 Rotation Logic

```ts
const today = new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0];

if (!DailyChallenge.exists({ date: today })) {
  const randomProblem = await Problem.aggregate([{ $sample: { size: 1 } }]);
  await DailyChallenge.create({
    date: today,
    problemId: randomProblem[0]._id,
  });
}
```

### 📦 DailyChallenge Schema (MongoDB)
```json
{
  _id: "daily123",
  date: "2025-07-18",
  problemId: "64a5c8...def"
}

```

### 👤 User Tracking
Each user has a ``dailyChallengeHistory`` array:

```json
{
  _id: "user123",
  name: "Sonu",
  dailyChallengeHistory: [
    { date: "2025-07-17", status: "Solved" },
    { date: "2025-07-18", status: "Unsolved" }
  ]
}
```

#### On successful submission:
```js
if (submission.status === "Accepted" && submission.problemId === todayProblemId) {
  user.dailyChallengeHistory.push({
    date: today,
    status: "Solved"
  });
  await user.save();
}
```

#### 🎨 UI Components
| Component           | Description                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 🔔 Daily Banner     | Top section of dashboard         |
| 🧠 Problem View     | Opens full problem + code editor |
| ✅ Solved Status     | Green checkmark on completion    |
| 📆 History Calendar | Heatmap view of solved dates     |

### 📤 API Endpoints

``GET /challenge/today`` → returns today’s problem

``POST /challenge/mark-solved`` → updates history

``GET /user/streak`` → returns current streak info

### 🔐 Edge Case Handling
User cannot solve tomorrow’s challenge early

If they skip a day, streak resets

If already solved outside daily challenge, still marked as solved
