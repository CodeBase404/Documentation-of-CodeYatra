## 🧠 How It Works

### 🪙 Scoring Logic (General)

```ts
score = totalAccepted * 10 - totalWrongSubmissions * 2
```

### 🧬 Contest Leaderboard Schema
```json
{
  contestId: "abc123",
  userId: "user123",
  score: 280,
  solved: ["p1", "p3"],
  submissions: [
    {
      problemId: "p1",
      status: "Accepted",
      language: "C++",
      time: "10:23",
    },
    {
      problemId: "p2",
      status: "Wrong Answer",
      language: "Java",
      time: "12:45"
    }
  ],
  finishTime: "00:45:23"
}
```

### 🧠 Real-time Updates (Socket.IO)
Contest room: socket.join(contestId)

On accepted submission:

```js
io.to(contestId).emit("leaderboard:update", updatedLeaderboard);
```
