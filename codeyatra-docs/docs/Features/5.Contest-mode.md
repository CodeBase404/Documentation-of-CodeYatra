## 🧩 Contest Structure

Each contest has:

|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `name`           | Contest name (e.g., Weekly Challenge #1)      |
| `startTime`      | Start date/time (ISO)                         |
| `endTime`        | End date/time (ISO)                           |
| `problems`       | Array of problem IDs                          |
| `participants`   | List of user IDs                              |

### Example Contest Schema (MongoDB)

```ts
{
  _id: "contest123",
  name: "Weekly Code War",
  startTime: "2025-08-01T14:00:00Z",
  endTime: "2025-08-01T15:30:00Z",
  problems: ["p1", "p2", "p3"],
  participants: ["u1", "u2", "u3"],
  type: "public"
}
```

### 🔒 Contest Locking
During the contest:

Problems are locked (not searchable or visible in problem list).

User can only access them via contest dashboard.

Submissions are evaluated only within the contest time.

### ⏳ Timer Logic
Client-side Countdown

```js
const duration = endTime - Date.now();
const timer = setInterval(() => {
  updateCountdown(duration - elapsedTime);
  if (elapsedTime >= duration) clearInterval(timer);
}, 1000);
```

Server-side Guard

```js
Server-side Guard
```

### 🧪 Submitting During Contest
Submissions are evaluated just like regular ones.

Each accepted submission adds points (e.g., +100).

Timestamps are tracked for leaderboard ranking.

#### Submission Schema (extended)

```json
{
  userId: "...",
  problemId: "...",
  contestId: "contest123",
  status: "Accepted",
  timestamp: "2025-08-01T14:12:30Z",
  language: "cpp"
}
```


### 🏆 Leaderboard Logic
#### Ranking Rules:
Sort by number of problems solved

Then by total finish time

Earlier accepted submissions rank higher

#### Example Entry
```js
{
  userId: "u123",
  username: "dev_sonu",
  solvedCount: 3,
  totalTime: "1:02:18",
  solvedProblems: [
    { problemId: "p1", status: "Accepted", time: "00:12:31", language: "cpp" },
    { problemId: "p2", status: "Accepted", time: "00:43:11", language: "java" },
  ]
}
```

### 🔴 Real-Time Features (via Socket.IO)

| Event                | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| leaderboard:update | On new accepted submission                  |
| timer:sync         | Broadcasts current time & remaining seconds |

```js
socket.emit("leaderboard:update", { contestId, updatedUserRank });
```
