# 🧾 Problem Listing

The **Problem Listing** page is the central place where users can browse, search, and filter coding problems by difficulty, tags, and status.

It mimics platforms like **LeetCode** and is designed to give a clean, intuitive interface for solving problems efficiently.

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🔍 1. Search Bar

Users can quickly search for problems by title or keywords.

- Supports fuzzy/full-text search
- Connected to MongoDB's text index or regex-based search
- Example: Searching "two sum" shows all problems with related titles or tags

### 🎛️ 2. Filters

Multiple filters allow users to narrow down the problem list based on criteria:

| Filter Type | Options |
|-------------|---------|
| Difficulty  | Easy, Medium, Hard |
| Tags        | Array, DP, Graph, Greedy, etc. |
| Status      | Solved, Unsolved |

These filters can be combined using query parameters in the backend.

### 📋 3. Problem Table

Each row in the problem list includes:

| Field        | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Title        | Problem name (clickable) |
| Difficulty   | Color-coded: 🟢 Easy, 🟡 Medium, 🔴 Hard |
