# System Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture for the LeetCode Clone project. It describes the key components, how they interact, and the overall technology stack.

## 🎯 Objective

To create a full-stack coding platform where users can:

* Browse and solve coding problems
* Participate in contests
* View real-time leaderboards
* Track submissions and performance
* Access daily challenges

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

The system is divided into three main parts:

```
Client (React.js)  ⇄  Server (Node.js + Express)  ⇄  MongoDB
                                     ⇅
                            Judge0 API (for code execution)
                                     ⇅
                            Cloudinary (for video/image)
```

## 🔧 Technologies Used

| Layer       | Technology                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Frontend    | React.js, Tailwind CSS      |
| Backend     | Node.js, Express.js         |
| Database    | MongoDB, Mongoose ORM       |
| Auth        | JWT (JSON Web Tokens)       |
| Code Judge  | Judge0 API                  |
| Cloud Media | Cloudinary                  |
| Docs        | Docusaurus                  |
| Realtime    | Socket.IO (for leaderboard) |

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 1. **Client**

* Developed using **React + Vite**
* Provides user-friendly UI for problem solving, contests, editor, and profile
* Interacts with backend via REST APIs
* Uses localStorage for temporary storage (e.g., code drafts)

### 2. **Server**

* Built with **Express.js**
* Handles user authentication, problem APIs, submission flow, and contest logic
* Integrates with Judge0 for code execution
* Emits real-time leaderboard updates using **Socket.IO**

### 3. **Database**

* **MongoDB** is used for storing:

  * User data
  * Problem metadata and test cases
  * Submissions
  * Contests and leaderboard history

### 4. **External Services**

* **Judge0 API**: Executes user code securely in different languages
* **Cloudinary**: Hosts editorial and tutorial videos

## 🔁 Data Flow Example (Problem Submission)

1. User writes code and hits "Run/Submit"
2. Client sends request to `/api/submissions`
3. Backend calls Judge0 API and awaits response
4. Once execution result is received:

   * It is compared with hidden test cases
   * Stored in MongoDB
   * Leaderboard (if in contest) is updated via socket
5. Client receives and displays result

## ✅ Key Features

* Full problem CRUD system for admins
* Real-time leaderboard for contests
* Rich code editor with themes and language support
* Daily coding challenges with tracking
* Secure JWT-based authentication
